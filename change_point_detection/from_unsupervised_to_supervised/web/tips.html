<li> Indicate the homogeneous segments of the packet loss fraction time series: click with the mouse's left button where you think the statistical properties (mean, variance, etc) have changed. A red line will be placed where you click. <a href="./imgs/example_classification.png" target="_blank">Classification example</a></li>
<li> You can remove the change points with the "Remove last change point" button. </li>
<li> In the case of packet loss fraction, mean changes between 0 and 0.1 are more sensible to the end users. Therefore, to improve your visualization capacity in this range, you can navigate through different scales (linear, polypoint and log). You can click in any scale. </li>
<li> Outlier is not a statistical change. An outlier is an observation that lies outside the overall pattern of a distribution. <a href="./imgs/example_outlier.png" target="_blank">Outlier example</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></li>
<li> Don't forget to click in "Save and next". </li>
