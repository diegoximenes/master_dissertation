\chapter{Applying Change Point Detection}
  In each algorithm section I will: Describe adaptations and aproaches. Describe dificulties of this algorithms in real data and in the current dataset that lead to adaptation.
  \section{Preprocessing}
  Filters applied to time series before presenting to algorithms.
  \section{Tuning Hyperparameters}
  	\subsection{Grid Search and Randomized Grid Search}
  	\subsection{Bayesian Optimization}
  	I don't know if I am going to use this method.
  	\subsection{Particle Swarm Optimization}
  	I don't know if I am going to use this method.
  \section{Sliding Window}
  \section{Dynamic Programming}
  \section{HMM}
  \section{Bayesian Inference}
  I don't know I will use this: poor performance.
  \section{LSTM}
  I don't know I will use this: maybe I will not have enough data. 
  \section{Ensembles}
  If there are enough models to be tested describe how to use ensembles.
