% Future work:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item collect datailed topology from the ISP which will enable more precise
% localizations
% \item previous problems database and end-users reclamations to the ISP call center.
% This can enable the problem be interpreted as a supervised problem.
% \item model the system as a reinforcement learning procedure, in which operators
% can feedback the system with correct/mistakes in the detection and localization
% of problems, then the system can be able to adapt automatically chossing the
% best algorithms and hyperparameters.
% \item active increase mesuremet frequency in locations with potential problems,
% avoiding incorrect classifications and decreasing the detection time.
% \item choose best network metrics that can increase the system performance
% \item if a more data is available try space aggregation techniques, as in Argus
% \item correlate path change in traceroute with changes in end-to-end metrics
% \item the proposed mechanism can also be expanded to detect attacks on networks
% \item catch other types of statistical changes, such as in periodicity
% \item is possible to detect and localize problems only with data collected
% passively?
% \end{itemize}
