\chapter{Literature Review of Change Point Detection Problem}

Here the change point problem will be "defined", including offline and online versions.

\section{Sliding Window Techniques}
Describe sliding window techniques in change point detection. Describe how two windows can be compared. Probably this technique will not be part of my solution, but I will write about it since is the simplest and most intuitive solution.

\section{Dynamic Programming}  
Optimization problem will be formulated and the solution algorithm will be presented. Also will be presented pruning techniques such as PELT.

\section{Bayesian Inference}
I will erase this section if I don't use bayesian inference. Describe Fearnheard (offline) and MacKay (online) solutions. Say that there are other versions.

\section{HMM}
I will not describe HMM algorithms (viterbi, baum welch, etc), I will only describe how HMM have been used in change point detection. Describe Left-Right HMM, full HMM, and Regularized HMM in this problem.

\section{Other Algorithms}
Only cite other used algorithms and say why I chose the previous one to analyse.

\section{Performance Evaluation}
  Describe how datasets are constructed in literature. Describe how an algorithm output is evaluated.
